My C projects

## Project 1: Subsitution-Based Cipher

Project 1 is an encryption algorithm that is based on substiution and permutation, which knowed as a substitution cipher.  The cipher takes a word as the key and encrypts the 26 letters.  Here is more relative information about the [substitution cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher)

1. I designed this cipher project into two parts:
+ The main.o for runing the project
+ The functions.o for the actually relative code for the cipher functionabilities.

2. How to run my project:
+ ./a.out (e/d) INPUT_KEY_WORD INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE
    - e refers to Encrypt
    - d refers to decrypt
+ Calling the makefile, by using 'make' in termina.  You can just modify the input keyword and input file path to test my projects.


## Project 2: Grocery Store Management Systemr

Project 2 is a management system for the grocery store. 

1. My designed this project into two parts:
+ The main.o for runing the project
+ The functions.o for the actually relative code for the management system functionabilities.
